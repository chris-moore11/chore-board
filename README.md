# Overview
Did Bart do it? Is it Bart's fault? If not Bart, then who?

It may be tempting to ask these questions, but the sage upon us are those who realize questions bear no weight in dark times like these. It matters not whether Bart did it, for we must blame him irregardless. It may not be an easy task, but we do not choose our own fate. We walk this path because it is the one that has been laid in front of us, and we follow it to its end in search of a justice that never was.

Curse you Bart.

# Captains Log

- `Feb 4, 2022`  
  An idea hit me in the depths of my covid isolation.. An idea so revolutionizing I wondered whether or not I should even act on it. I realized it must be done. A chore board must be built. And I am going to build it.

- `Feb 5, 2022`  
  Morale is waning. My idealism for building the perfect web app is at odds with getting anything done. We push on.

- `Feb 6, 2022`  
  My roommates will have no idea how much time this took.

- `Feb 23, 2022`  
  There's a new captain on board and he hates `pgAdmin`.
